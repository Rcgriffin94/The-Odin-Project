        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                When ready to cook, set the smoker temperature to 450℉ and preheat with the lid closed for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine ground chuck, Parmesan cheese, and Traeger Beef Rub. Wet your hands with cold water and
                 mix gently to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the meat into 4 equal portions. With wet hands, shape each portion of beef into a patty about 4 inches in
                 diameter and 3/4 inch thick. Do not overwork the meat. Using your thumbs, make a wide, shallow depression on the
                 top of each burger.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise and Traeger 'Que BBQ Sauce. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
            </li>
            <li>B
                rush the cut sides of the Kaiser rolls with the melted butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange the burgers directly on the grill grates, depression-side down. Insert the probe horizontally into 
                the center of a burger. Cook, flipping once, until the internal temperature reaches 160°F, or 
                your desired temperature, 8-10 minutes per side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, place rolls cut-side down on the grill and cook until lightly browned, 2-4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the rolls from the grill and spread the cut sides with the BBQ-mayonnaise sauce. Place a burger patty on
                 each roll bottom, then top with lettuce, onion, tomato, and pickles. Finish with the top of the rolls. Enjoy!
